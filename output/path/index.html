<p>When you go to look for a hairbrush, it could be a in a few places. Maybe in your bathroom cabinet, maybe on the sink, maybe in your bedroom. Probably not on top of the ceiling fan, probably not in a bag of sugar.</p>
<p>When you type a command on your computer – like, say, <code>hairbrush</code> – the computer doesn’t look in every single place that exists on your computer. Instead, it goes down a list of places called the <code>PATH</code> that contain software it can run.</p>
<p>The biggest issue you’ll have in your entire life is <strong>your command line not being able to find software after you’ve installed it.</strong> Generally this is a PATH issue: if the bathroom sink isn’t listed on the PATH, your computer will never find the hairbrush!</p>
<h2 id="setting-your-path-in-os-x">Setting your PATH in OS X</h2>
<p>The PATH is generally set in the <code>.bashrc</code>/<code>.bash_profile</code> or <code>.zprofile</code>/<code>.zshrc</code> files, depending on <a href="../bash-vs-zsh">which shell you have</a>.</p>
<p>There’s usually a line that says something like</p>
<pre><code>export PATH=/usr/local/bathroom_sink:$PATH</code></pre>
<p>which adds the <code>/usr/local/bathroom_sink</code> directory to your PATH.</p>
<h2 id="settings-your-path-in-windows">Settings your PATH in Windows</h2>
<p>This is not as fun! In Windows you get to click around and manage <strong>environment variables</strong>.</p>
