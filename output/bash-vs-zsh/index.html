<p>The command line looks boring enough that you’d think it was the same everywhere, but it isn’t true! There are actually a handful of different varieties of the command line – technically speaking, they’re called <strong>shells</strong>.</p>
<p>Back in the day, the default shell in OS X was something called <strong>bash</strong>.</p>
<p>Then, during some OS X update, the default shell suddenly became <strong>zsh</strong> (or <strong>zshell</strong>)!</p>
<p>Does this matter? Do you care? No, not really! Bash and zsh operate exactly the same as far as you’re concerned, but there’s one gotcha: <em>it can really screw things up when you try to install things on your computer.</em> This mostly has to do with startup files, and making sure things go in the right place.</p>
<h2 id="startup-files">Startup files</h2>
<p>When you start up Terminal, it runs a couple files to set things up. It’ll adjust your <code>PATH</code> to let your computer know where to look for things, it’ll set up <code>pyenv</code> to figure out what version of Python it should be using, it’ll do blah blah whatever else you tell it to do.</p>
<p>The way it knows what to set up is <strong>startup files</strong> or <strong>initialization files</strong>. I don’t have an internet connection right now so let’s be honest: I made both of those terms up.</p>
<p>Based on what shell you’re using, different startup files get run!</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re using <strong>bash</strong>, it runs <code>.bash_profile</code> and <code>.bashrc</code></li>
<li>If you’re using <strong>zshell</strong>, it runs <code>.zprofile</code> and <code>.zshrc</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The best is when your computer suggests you switch from bash to zshell, and as a result you lose all of your settings. It’s cute!</p>
<h2 id="figuring-things-out">Figuring things out</h2>
<p>I have a YouTube video about this! It’s oddly popular because this issue causes problems for every human on the planet. <a href="youtube.com/watch?v=OfCbtMN9-Jo">How to fix bash_profile/PATH not working in OS X Catalina Terminal by using zshrc instead</a></p>
