<p>When you’re starting up a Jupyter server, you might get a message about “the port already being in use.” The server will work, the notebooks will open, but it’s still confusing! It might look something like one of these:</p>
<pre><code>[I 07:28:23.107 NotebookApp] The port 8888 is already in use, trying another port.
[I 07:28:23.107 NotebookApp] The port 8889 is already in use, trying another port.
[I 07:28:23.107 NotebookApp] The port 8890 is already in use, trying another port.</code></pre>
<p>This happens when you start a new Jupyter server <strong>after you’re already running a Jupyter server</strong>. Maybe you minimized the Terminal window, forgot about it, and started a brand-new one.</p>
<p>A ‘port’ is basically an address on your computer. By default, Jupyter uses port <code>8888</code> to let you talk to it (you can see this in the URL when you’re looking at a notebook: <code>localhost:8888</code>). If you’re already running a server, it will try <code>8889</code>, then <code>8890</code>, then <code>8891</code> and so on, until it finds an opening.</p>
<p>While this isn’t really a <em>problem</em> or <em>error</em>, you probably don’t need to be running multiple Jupyter servers! Before starting a new one, always check at <a href="http://localhost:8888">http://localhost:8888</a> to see if a server is already running.</p>
