<h2 id="in-class-summary">In-class summary</h2>
<p>We started off with the easy stuff: <a href="../syllabus/">reviewing the syllabus</a>.</p>
<p>Then we started <strong>downloading software</strong>, and found out <a href="../downloading-software/">downloading and running software is complicated!</a> The main focus was installing Python with <a href="http://littlecolumns.com/tools/python-wrangler/">Python Wrangler</a>.</p>
<p>Most of our setup happened on the <strong>command line</strong>, which was generally new territory. We learned <a href="../running-cli-commands/">how to run commands on the terminal</a>, what to do <a href="../passwords/">when the command line asks for your password</a>, and talked a little bit about <a href="../package-managers/">package managers</a> (which Homebrew is an example of). We tried to google our way to some solutions, but only learned one thing: <a href="../using-sudo/">never use sudo!</a></p>
<p>For the command line, Windows people used <a href="https://cmder.net/">Cmder</a> while OS X people used Terminal (which we discovered could be hiding <a href="../bash-vs-zsh/">bash or zsh</a>). <strong>The difference between bash and zsh</strong> caused some trouble, especially when pyenv asked us to edit the <a href="../startup-files-for-shells/">shell startup files</a>. These startup files are used to <a href="../path/">set up the PATH variable</a>, so when we type a command the computer knows how to look for it.</p>
<p>Running commands can <a href="../running-cli-commands/">end up causing trouble sometimes</a>, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Based on what we’re doing (Python? command line? SQL?) we might end up with <a href="../different-prompts/"><strong>different prompts</strong> that can run completely different commands</a>! We didn’t talk about it during class, but I promise it’s going to be a common problem we run into when working with SQL.</p>
<p>Another thing we didn’t get to was <a href="../how-to-run-python-files">how to run Python scripts from the command line</a>. In your pre-work all you did was type in little boxes! Don’t worry, though, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUIlwDPmztg">I made a quick video for you</a>.</p>
<h2 id="homework">Homework</h2>
<p>For your homework, you’re going to be working on the skills you learned from the <a href="http://littlecolumns.com/learn/python">Python tutorial</a>, and turning your <a href="https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html">Terminus</a> abilities into real-life command line powers.</p>
<p>There will also be a quiz about some of the terms we learned and used during class. The material above should get you to the finish line on that one.</p>
