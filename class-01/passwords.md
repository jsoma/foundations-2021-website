title: What do I do when the command line asks me for my password?
---

When the command line asks you for your password, **you type it.**

It might look something like this:

```
Enter password:
```

The password it's asking you for is the password you use to log in to your computer.** Not your email password, not your school password, not your NeoPets or MySpace password. It just wants to make sure you're actually the boss of the computer.

When you type your password in, nothing will show up. **That's normal!** Instead of doing something like \*\*\*\*\* as you type your password in like a normal login box does, the command line wants to be extra secret and not show *anything*.

Just trust it's getting each and every keypress. Then hit enter. Life will be great, things will install, rainbows will shine.
