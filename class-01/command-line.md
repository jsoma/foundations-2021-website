title: The Command Line
---

To get down into the nuts and bolts of the computer, we need to use something called the **command line**. It’s also called the _terminal_, _bash prompt_, _shell_, _zsh_ or a hundred other weird names. Whenever you’re using it people who walk by notice will be amazed!

Getting to the command line is a little different depending on what operating system you use, though, so let’s figure out how to do that now.

## Mac OS X

OS X is built on top of something called _Darwin_, which is built on something _else_ called BSD, which is flavor of something you may have heard of called _Linux_. All of that is really just a boring way of saying "the command line is easy to use and works great in OS X." Lucky you!

To use the command line (a.k.a. Terminal) in OS X, click the little magnifying glass in the top right-hand corner and type "Terminal." It should show up, you can click it, and tada! It works.

If it doesn’t show up, you’ll need to open up your Applications folder, then go into Utilities, and finally track down Terminal.

> To open the command line on OS X, run the **Terminal** application.

To test that you’re on the command line, type `ls` (that’s a little L, not a big i) and hit enter. Does it look like some stuff? Great, it worked!

## Windows

There are two major ways to use the command line on Windows, the Command Prompt or PowerShell. Because we're feisty **we aren't going to use either of them.**

Instead, you're going to download [Cmder](https://cmder.net/) – make sure you downloading the **Full version**.
